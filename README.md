Genetic Algorithm for Pokemon Simulation

Uses the Pokemon-Showdown module to simulate Pokemon Battles

Originally designed for VGC 2024 Regulation G

Goal is to find the "best" core team of Pokemon.

Genetic Algorithm with Simulated Annealing is one of the most efficient ways to find the best team since teams are non-continuous NP-HARD problem inputs. (The Problem, of course being finding the strongest one)

Teams are essentially just chromosomes that we can crossover and mutate to produce better offspring.

Do this enough times, and BAM! You find the best team.

Current settings do 1 million battle simulations

Also, Mewtwo is The Genetic Pokemon
